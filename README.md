PCOS Ultrasonic Image Detection Project
Overview
This repository documents the PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) ultrasonic image detection project developed during a machine learning internship. The project focuses on the detection and analysis of ultrasonic images to aid in the diagnosis of PCOS, a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age.

Objective
The primary objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying PCOS-related patterns and abnormalities in ultrasonic images of the ovaries. By automating the detection process, the aim was to assist healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses, leading to improved patient outcomes.

Key Components
Data Collection: Ultrasonic images of ovaries from individuals with and without PCOS were collected from various medical sources and repositories.
Preprocessing: The collected images underwent preprocessing steps, including resizing, normalization, and noise reduction, to enhance the quality and uniformity of the dataset.
Model Development: Several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were explored and trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn discriminative features indicative of PCOS.
Evaluation: The performance of the developed models was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set to ensure robustness and generalization.
Deployment: A prototype application or inference pipeline was created to demonstrate the model's utility in real-world scenarios, allowing for seamless integration into clinical workflows.
